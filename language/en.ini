EDDH3=>The Digital Dilettante
EDDP1=><a href="https://eldiletantedigital.com" target="_blank">The Digital Dilettante (2006-2011)</a> was a project founded in the University of Arts of Cuba (ISA), and was active from the years 2006 to 2011. During this period the artworks of more than twenty artists were compiled (some of them teachers and other students). The Digital Dilettante worked as an online gallery to promote novel and well known Cuban artists. 
EDDP2=>Among the goals of the project was:
EDDL1=>to explore the expression possibilities that new technologies, especially the Internet, provided to the artists;
EDDL2=>to help other artists in the creation of their works, since in the context of Cuba access to the new technologies and Internet was very limited;
EDDL3=>to create a space for the debate of the main notions and concepts that guide creation in the field of emerging media (more than twelve articles were published);
EDDL4=>to help students accomplish their goals and graduate with works and degree thesis related to new media art.
EDDP3=>Several workshops also took place:
EDDL5=><a href="https://eldiletantedigital.com/documentos/vukcosic.html" target="_blank">How to be Vuk Cosic in 3 Easy Steps (2009)</a>. With the artworks of several students compiled as you can see in this video: <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/280112250?h=f28f88ed1e" target="_blank">Vimeo</a>. This was also when I built my own distribution of Linux, called Kitten Linux, based on Slackware. The favicon of this website, that depicts a white cat, is a legacy from those times.
EDDL6=><a href="https://eldiletantedigital.com/documentos/hackinglily.html" target="_blank">Hacksing Lily (2011)</a>. Workshop and show with works of Raúl Aguiar, Jorge B. Rodríguez, Amilkar Feria, Samuel Riera and Yonlay Cabrera. It took place during the VII Coloquio Internacional de Estética y Arte. Several intellectuals as Kenneth Goldsmith, Rachel Price, Victor Fowler and frency, participated in the debate.
EDDL7=><a href="https://eldiletantedigital.com/documentos/pe/" target="_blank">Electronic Poetry Multimedia (2011)</a>. I compiled very dispersed materials related to electronic and digital poetry and as far as I know the only attempt in Cuba to do so. It was later presented in the event "BEYOND THE HYPHEN. APPROACHING A POST GEOGRAPHIC CUBA." in Princeton University. 
EDDP4=>Along the actual artistic praxis I analyzed the concepts we were using in our discourse. This philosophy-aesthetical research became my master degree thesis; a resume of which was later published in the book <a href="/book">"Outlooks on Digital Art"</a>.
BOOKH3=>Outlooks on Digital Art
BOOKP1=>In 2017 the three authors of the book met at the University of Guadalajara (Mexico) for a conference in the permanent seminar of IGCAAV. During this meeting we shared ideas and insights about digital art. It took little more than two years for this intellectual adventure to end with the publication of this book in 2020. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Perspectiva-del-arte-digital-Spanish/dp/B08LNL5BW8" target="_blank">Buy it from Amazon</a>.
BOOKP2=>The book consists of three chapters: The first one, by Caleb Olvera, develops the theory of Analogic Hermeneutics in it’s application to the study of the digital world, in particular to the concepts of virtuality and body. The second chapter, by Hermann O. Amaya, focuses on the digital image, specifically in the ASCII art, explaining what it is and the relevance it has in the field of digital art. The third and final chapter is a resume of my Masters degree research in which I develop the concept of Artistic Practices of Internet and apply it to the new media art project <a href="https://eldiletantedigital.com" target="_blank">The Digital Dilettante</a>, that was founded by me when I was teaching in the University of Arts of Cuba.
BOOKP3=>A quote from Sixto Castro who was kind enough to write the prologue of the book:

APPH3=>Pitch
APPP1=>All these photos were processed with a special application I designed and programmed. I forgot a long time ago if I'm a programmer who learned how to make art, or an artist who learned how to code. In a way, I do exactly what many other artists do, copy from reality. But I designed my own brush; I created the process to express myself. 
APPP2=>The technique used is called ASCII art, but with the help of new code libraries I took it to the next level. The resulting images are more pictorial than previous text art works.
APPP3=>This allows me to address, from an interdisciplinary perspective that includes literature and photography, the intersection between imitation and representation. In essence, I explore sensorial perception in a game of seduction and distances, in which the spectator must step away to recover the closeness to the images.
APPP4=>I also focus on the unconcealment of the communicational logic underneath the digital technologies, and the underlying code of the digital images.
APPP5=>In the video you can see the application at work.
ARTP1=>I have ventured into visual arts and literature from an interdisciplinary perspective. My artistic interests are linked to the new technologies and especially focused on the unconcealment of their communicational logic. My works have been included in art shows like "Ojalá!" (Zeitgenössische kubanische Kunst, Berlin, 2015) and <a href="https://esmoa.org/experience/hope/" target="_blank">Hope</a> (ESMoA, Los Angeles, 2017). Founder of the project <a href="/edd">El Diletante Digital</a>.
ARTP2=>I have worked as a professor at the University of Arts of Cuba (ISA), the University of Havana and Miami Dade College. I have participated as a speaker in several events like <a href="http://beyondthehyphen.blogspot.com/p/about.html" target="_blank">Beyond the Hyphen. Approaching a Post Geographic Cuba</a> (Princeton University, 2014) and the <a href="http://www.suv.udg.mx/noticia/experto-internacional-conferencia-practicas-artisticas-internet" target="_blank">Permanent Seminar of the IGCAAV</a> (Universidad de Guadalajara, 2017). My master's thesis was published in the book <a href="/book">Outlooks on Digital Art</a> (Mexico, 2020). 
ARTP3=>Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy, University of Havana (2004). Masters in Art History, University of Havana (2011).
